# Titanic â€“ Data Cleaning & Exploration

## Project Overview
This project uses the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to practice **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
The ultimate goal is to build a clean dataset suitable for predictive modeling of passenger survival.

For now, the focus is on:
- Loading the raw data
- Inspecting structure and missing values
- Beginning exploratory analysis (EDA)
